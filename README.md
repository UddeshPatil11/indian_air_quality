# indian_air_quality(AQI)
This project uses machine learning to predict the air quality index (AQI) in India. The data used for this project was collected from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and includes hourly and daily AQI readings for various cities in India. The project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest Regressor, Ada Boost Regressor, and Bagging Regressor, to predict the AQI. The project also includes a visualization of the predicted AQI for various cities in India.
